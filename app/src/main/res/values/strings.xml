        <b>Nosema apis</b> is a microsporidian, a small, unicellular parasite recently
        reclassified as a fungus that mainly affects honey bees. It causes <b>nosemosis</b>, also called <b>nosema</b>, which is
        the most common and widespread of adult honey bee diseases.<i>[1]</i> The dormant stage of <i>N. apis</i> is a long-lived spore which
        is resistant to temperature extremes and dehydration, and cannot be killed by freezing the contaminated comb. Nosemosis
        is a listed disease with the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). \n \n

        2nd Ed., Georg Thieme 2008, ISBN 978-3-8304-1072-0, p. 140. \n \n
        <b>Effects on the hive</b> \n \n
        Nosema spores are spread to other colony members through fecal matter. The disease impairs the digestion of pollen, thereby shortening
        the life of the bee. A greater proportion of worker bees become infected than drones or queens, probably due to the comb-cleaning activities
        of young bees in which drones and queens do not participate. Nosema-infected bees do not attend or feed the queen to the same extent as healthy
        bees, which helps the queen to escape infection. When the queen becomes infected, her ovaries degenerate and her egg-laying capacity is reduced
        due to atrophy of the oocytes. Queens that become infected by the parasite during the brood-rearing season are superseded by the bees. \n \n
        The seasonal trend of typical infections exhibits low levels during summer, a small peak in autumn, and a slow rise of infection during winter.
        It is more common during times of confinement - winter and spring. In the spring, the level of infection increases rapidly as brood-rearing starts
        and while flight possibilities are still limited. Colonies in northern climates are more seriously affected than colonies in the south because of
        the increased amount of time bees are confined in the hive. Nosema, if left untreated, can cause queen supersedure, winter kills, reduced honey
        yields, and dwindling populations.

        <b>Ascosphaera apis</b> is the fungal cause of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) larval disease chalkbrood. Spores of this fungus germinate within the
        digestive tract of bees, then begin mycelial growth during the last instar of larval development. Dead larval and pupal bees appear chalky thanks
        to growth throughout the bee of mycelia. These chalky \'mummies\' are highly infectious, and spores of this fungus often reinfect colonies via
        stored food supplies or direct transport to younger larvae by adult bees working within the nest. Adult bees reduce the effects of this fungus on
        the colony by frequently identifying and removing diseased individuals. The disease is associated with high brood density (productivity) and cooler
        outside temperatures. \n \n
